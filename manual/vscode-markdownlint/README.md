Markdown linting and style checking for Visual Studio Code.

The [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided. For example, [here are some common/troublesome Markdown constructs](https://gist.github.com/DavidAnson/006a6c2a2d9d7b21b025).

[markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) is a Visual Studio Code extension that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by [markdownlint for Node.js](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) which is based on [markdownlint for Ruby](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint).

## Notes

* The package always installs the latest version of the extension.
  The version of the Chocolatey package reflects not the version of the extension.
