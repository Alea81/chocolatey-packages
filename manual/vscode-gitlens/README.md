Supercharge the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code â€” Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more

[GitLens](http://gitlens.amod.io "Learn more about GitLens") is an [open-source](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens "Open GitLens on GitHub") extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) created by [Eric Amodio](http://www.amod.io "Learn more about Eric").
While GitLens is generously offered to everyone free of charge, if you find it useful please consider [supporting](#support-gitlens "Support GitLens") it.

GitLens simply helps you understand code better. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to gain further insights as to how and why the code evolved. Explore the history and evolution of a codebase.
